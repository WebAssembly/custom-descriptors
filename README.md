# Custom RTTs

This repository contains the WebAssembly proposal for custom RTTs and JS interop for Wasm GC structs.
It is based on the [SpecTec fork](https://github.com/Wasm-DSL/spectec) of the spec repository,
which is in turn based on the `wasm-3.0` branch of [github.com/WebAssembly/spec/](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/).
See the [overview](proposals/custom-rtts/Overview.md) for more information.

Original `README` from upstream repository follows...

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly specification,
a reference implementation, and the official test suite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).

# citing

For citing WebAssembly in LaTeX, use [this bibtex file](wasm-specs.bib).
